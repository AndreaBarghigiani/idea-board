# Dan Page - Mentorcruise base test

Project build as part of my mentorship program with Dan Page.

The project has been built with Vite.js + React and `pnpm`.

```bash
# Install packages
pnpm install

# Run the platform
pnpm run dev
```

Now you can check the project at `http://localhost:5173`

### What if I do not have `pnpm`?

Just follow the [installation instructions](https://pnpm.io/installation) provided by the main site.

### What if I don't want to use `pnpm`?

If you don't want to use `pnpm` at all, just delete `pnpm-lock.yaml` and run a standard `npm install` and `npm run dev` to run the project.
